Off The Shelf is a cross platform react app where users can sell their books they no longer need.

As of now, I've built most of the pages I need with react.js. Now I am currently working on adding navigation and setting up the backend. Other features I will be adding include getting user location, authentication & authorization, notifications, uploading images and more.
